<h1>Bill Splitter</h1>

<p>
  I create this so that every time I come back from the billiards club, I do not have to do any calculation to split the bill.
</p>

<p>
  This program assumes that the start time and end time is within 24 hours, if you play more than that, you need a therapy, not a bill splitter.

<h2>How To Use</h2>
<p>
  Download as a zip file, or clone this repo into your local machine.

<p>
  Upload a text file that follows this template <a href="https://github.com/ngkhanggg/bill-splitter/blob/main/log.txt" target="_self">log.txt</a>.
  Keep in mind that each player' name must be unique, and the start time and end time must follow this format hh:mm.
  <pre><code>player1,hh:mm,hh:mm
player2,hh:mm,hh:mm
player3,hh:mm,hh:mm
...</code></pre>
